# Pascal's Triangle challenge

When I started programming last year I began with the Python language. As I hadn't done much computing before it took me a while to get my head round it but eventually it started to stick. In August 2017, I was given the challenge of 
creating Pascal's triangle in Python. It was pouring over this for hours that made me realise I was hooked.

Some of my workings out - breaking the problem down into simple steps:

From the files that worked on last August it is clear that I hadn't gotten used to versioning yet but I have put them on GitHub now for reference. Below is the current version of the triangle. I have plans to get it looking more triangle like in the future.

After this I went on to try to create a function as you can see from the function files. This project is incomplete but it is something I would like to go back to in the future.
