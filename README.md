# Pascal's Triangle challenge

When I started programming last year I began with the Python language. It took me quite a while to get my head round it as I 
hadn't done much computing before but eventually I started to get it. Then, in August 2017, I was given the challenge of 
creating Pascal's triangle in Python. It was pouring over this for hours that made me realise I was hooked.

From the files that worked on last August it is clear that I hadn't gotten used to versioning yet but I have put them on GitHub
now for reference.

I then went on to try to create a function but this is incomplete as I moved on at the time to working on something else.
This is something I would like to go back to in the future.
